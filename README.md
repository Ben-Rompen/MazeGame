# MazeGame
WIP online maze-navigating game created as an experiment. Procedurally generates a 2D maze. Very incomplete.

This project uses mainloop.min.js, created by Isaac Sukin (http://www.isaacsukin.com/) and used under the MIT license.

The goal of this game was to experiment with game loop logic, input and output processing, and eventually WebGL in a game environment, written in JavaScript. The end product is planned to be a pseudo-3D game with first-person navigation implementing mouselook like a modern FPS.

Milestones: (x = met, o = in-progress, - = not yet started)
x 2D draw maze
o 2D navigation and collision
- 3D perspective view
x Maze generation algorithm
x Start/pause/reset screens
- (nice to have) "monster" AI (simple maze-solving and pathfinding)
- (nice to have) lighting & effects
- (nice to have) art assets
- (nice to have) sounds
- (super-duper extra) mobile controls
